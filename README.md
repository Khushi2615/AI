DFS and BFS for 8-Puzzle Problem 
• 8-Puzzle: A sliding tile puzzle aiming to reach a goal state.
• BFS: Explores level by level, guaranteed to find the shortest path.
• DFS: Explores depth-first, using less memory but may not find the shortest path.
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) 
• CSP: Solves problems with variables, domains, and constraints. 
• Example: Sudoku, where constraints ensure no repetition of numbers in rows, columns, or grids.
Parsing Family Tree Using Knowledge Base 
• KB: A collection of facts and rules used to infer relationships like parent, child, and sibling in a family tree.
A* Algorithm 
• A*: Combines actual cost (g) and heuristic (h) to find the most efficient path. It is optimal if the heuristic is admissible.
Minimax Algorithm • Minimax: Used in game-playing AI to minimize the possible loss by assuming the opponent plays optimally.
8-Queens Problem with Basic Search 
• 8-Queens: A problem of placing 8 queens on a chessboard where no two queens can attack each other.
Forward Chaining Algorithm 
• Forward Chaining: A rule-based inference method that starts with known facts and applies rules to reach a conclusion.
Backward Chaining Algorithm 
• Backward Chaining: A rule-based approach that starts with the goal and works backward to find supporting facts.
Chatbot Application
• A chatbot simulates human conversation for tasks like customer support. It uses natural language processing (NLP) for real-time responses.
